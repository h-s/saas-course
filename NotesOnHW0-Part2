Dear Professor,

I'd like to apply for an exemption for posting YouTube video of myself working solo on the assignment because of privacy reasons. 
I just don't feel comfortable posting such video in the internet. I hope that you would grant me the exemption.

Regarding working solo versus pair programming, I thought it would be best that I learn and discover the Ruby language on my own. 
I know that in production settings, pair programming does offer a lot of advantages as promoted by Kent Beck, and I agree with
his approach in Extreme Programming. But in learning environment, I'd like to go on my own pace without slowing down the other person. 
I hope you would grant me the leisurely approach of discovering Ruby.

My thought on the assignment is that Regular Expression can be very tricky to write correctly.

    

Thank you.
