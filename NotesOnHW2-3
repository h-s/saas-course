Dear Professor,

I'd like to apply for an exemption for posting YouTube video of myself working solo on the assignment
because of privacy reasons. I just don't feel comfortable posting such video in the internet.
I hope that you would grant me the exemption.

Regarding working solo versus pair programming, I thought it would be best that I learn and discover
the Ruby language on my own. I know that in production settings, pair programming does offer a lot of
advantages and I agree with this approach in Extreme Programming.
But in learning environment, I'd like to go on my own pace without slowing down the other person.
I hope you would grant me the leisurely approach of discovering Ruby.

My thought on the assignment (Part 3) is that it's a bit tricky to set the checkboxes in the form. 
It is also a bit triky to relate the hashes in params and session with the form elements.
I enjoy doing the assignment.


Thank you.
