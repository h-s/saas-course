Dear Professor,

I'd like to apply for an exemption for posting YouTube video of myself working solo on the assignment because of privacy reasons. I just don't feel comfortable posting such video in the internet. I hope that you would grant me the exemption.

Regarding working solo versus pair programming, I thought it would be best that I learn and discover the Ruby language on my own. I know that in production settings, pair programming does offer a lot of advantages as promoted by Kent Beck, and I agree with his approach in Extreme Programming. But in learning environment, I'd like to go on my own pace without slowing down the other person. I hope you would grant me the leisurely approach of discovering Ruby.

My thought on the assignment can be summarized as follows:

1. It is a good way to learn about Array and Enumerable capabilities. I am not sure why the assignment refers to documentation for Hash. I did not use any Hash functionality at all.

2. I am still learning about Ruby idioms (which are interesting). I made a mistake in sum_to_n? part of the assignment because I forgot to include the question mark in the method name. I guess I did not read the instruction carefully enough.

Thank you.
